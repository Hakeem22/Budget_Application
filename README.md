# Budget Application

This project is my first work I have done inside of the PHP programming language, and the main purpose of creating this project was to understand how the PHP programming language works. 
The website contains very basic functionalitiy of login/logout, registration page, and a forgotten password platform for end users. There is very basic front-end work that has bootstrap incoroporated to the project.
I have applied a small budget platform to the home screen, this is to track the end users expenses for the month, and they would need to manually type their expenses into the platform.
